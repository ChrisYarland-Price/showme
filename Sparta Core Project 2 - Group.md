# Sparta Core Project 2 - Group

Congratulation Spartans for making it through your first five weeks of training! 

To consolidate your learning, you must now produce a project using any and all of the technology that you have learnt within the past five weeks of the course. 

## Task 

Your task is to collaborate in an agile product development team to deliver a fully functioning prototype application to your client.  


#### Sparta Digital Showcase - Codename: *ShowMe*

The app’s primary purpose is to act as a portfolio of past and present Spartan projects. The user base of this application will be Sparta Staff, existing Spartans and current Trainee Spartans. 

The client has requested that all published projects should be public for anyone to see however all other functionality should be restricted to members only. 

All development teams will have a scheduled scoping session with their client in the afternoon of Monday 9th October. This will be your primary opportunity to probe and question the client to establish a comprehensive set of project requirements. 

Your client expects their minimum requirements to be met however they are trusting you to advise on potential additional features that could improve the application. 

### Important Information
---

It is **YOUR** responsibility to establish a set of product requirements from your client in order for you and your team to fill an accurate and prioritised **product backlog** of **user stories**.

You **MUST** follow the SCRUM methodology when collaborating to construct the application and you **MUST** be able to present sufficient evidence of ceremonies/artefacts to your client.

Evidence examples: 
- **Photographs of artefacts**
- **Progress Charts**
- **Meeting minutes and summaries**

Your project should contain 2 sprints, both of which should last approximately 3 days. For each sprint you should carry out all SCRUM ceremonies detailed below:

| Ceremony                |
|-------------------------|
| Release Planning        |
| Sprint 1 Planning       |
| Sprint 1 Review         |
| Sprint 1 Retrospective  |
| Sprint 2 Planning       |
| Sprint 2 Review         |
| Sprint 2 Retrospective  |

You and your team should also make use of **Daily Standup Meetings** to aid communication.

#### ReadMe
You MUST have a detailed readme.md file documenting the entire project including a section detailing how to get the app up and running locally, project requirements, technology used and approach. 


#### Presentation
You and your team will be requited to deliver a 15 minute presentation describing the development process, your approach and a working demo of the application. This will be followed by a Q&A.


## Planning

We strongly advise that you take the time to plan your project well. You should include all planning documents in your presentation. 

It is recommended to setup an online project management tool (Trello/jira) to mirror your physical SCRUM Board.



## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a Full Stack web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.
* To collaborate in an agile team.
* To test your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

**You will not only be assed as team for this project but also for your individual contributions to the product! So show us what you've got!**




## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-commented. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your controllers, models, etc?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Fully git tracked with an acceptable amount of git comments. 

We’ll also be looking at:

* How you use git to collaborate as a team. 
* How review each others code and give appropriate feedback to fellow team members. 
* How well you followed the agile process. 
* How accurate your estimations.

Remember! Burn-down Charts don't lie!
